browser-wireframe
=================

A minimalist and a not-so-minimal browser wireframe made with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), hope it's helpful for your mockups and working.

Inspired by [Minimus V](http://elgena.co/),  Benjamin De Cock's [Safari for Sketch](http://dribbble.com/shots/815922-Safari) and the lack of low-fidelity browser assets.
